      <p>. Hello! My name is Jonathan Pena and I am a rising third-year student attending Cal Poly Pomona. 
      I am a first-generation student and a son of immigrant parents. I am passionate about science and space. 
      Hopefully, one day, I can be a part of the Artemis Generation and help progress human exploration. </p>
    
      <p>  Outside of school, I have little to no free time. The majority of the time I spend working for my family's 
      business which is sports field maintenance and renovation. Yet the times when I have a time slot, I spend that 
      time resting or watching educational videos/podcasts related to cars or science.</p>

      <h3>Hidden Talent</h3>
      <p1>  A hidden talent that I have that many do not know is that I am a great Bachata dancer. 
      Bachata is a genre of Hispanic music that originated in the Dominican Republic and it is 
      a romantic dance that needs a partner. I would consider myself a stiff person when it comes 
      to dancing or just any regular activities, but when that specific genre of music plays I am 
      a completely different person. When I used to be a chambelan for a couple of girls' quinceañeras, 
      I was always the main dancer and did solos with the quinceañera whenever they wanted a choreographed 
      Bachata dance for their big day. If you are new to the genre of music, below will be the link to my 
      bachata playlist. -June 7,2022 </p1>
