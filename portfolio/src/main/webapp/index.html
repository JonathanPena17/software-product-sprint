      <p> About me:</p>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan! I'm a CS student attending Cal Poly Pomona and 
        a first-generation college student. My parents are from Jalisco and Nayarit, Mexico. 
        I have four siblings, me being the only male. Outside of college, I have a hectic life 
        working for the family business. The business provides sports field maintenance and 
        renovation services. I've been working alongside my family since I was twelve.</p>
