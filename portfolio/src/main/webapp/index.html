      <p>. Hello! My name is Jonathan Pena and I am a rising third-year student attending Cal Poly Pomona. 
      I am a first-generation student and a son of immigrant parents. I am passionate about science and space. 
      Hopefully, one day, I can be a part of the Artemis Generation and help progress human exploration. </p>
    
      <p>  Outside of school, I have little to no free time. The majority of the time I spend working for my family's 
      business which is sports field maintenance and renovation. Yet the times when I have a time slot, I spend that 
      time resting or watching educational videos/podcasts related to cars or science.</p>
